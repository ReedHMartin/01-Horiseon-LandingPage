# Horiseon Landing Page

## HTML and CSS project #1

The intent of this project was to refactor existing HTML into Semantic HTML and update the style sheet accordingly.

- The existing code was not in semantic HTML and the tags were not descriptive.
- The style sheet was overly complicated and making the HTML semantic allowed for a more simplified style sheet with fewer selectors.
- Many class selectors were able to have reduced specificity or be removed by making the HTML tags more specific to their actual purpose.
